`Operational UI` is an opinionated set of building blocks designed to best support user interfaces used for operational decision-making.


## Getting started

The `@operational/components` library contains atomic building blocks, and is a good place to start with Operational UI packages.

To install, simply grab the package via npm or yarn, along with `React` and `ReactDOM`:

`npm install @operational/components react react-dom`

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { render } from "react-dom"
import { OperationalUI, Button } from "@operational/components"

const MyInterface = () => (
  <OperationalUI>
    <Button onClick={() => {alert("Hello!")}}>Say hello!</Button>
  </OperationalUI>
)

render(<MyInterface />, document.querySelector("#app"))
```

Wrapping the interface inside an `OperationalUI` is required for the components to render properly - it does important setup work and allows for customization later (see [package docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40operational%2Fcomponents) for details).

## Next Steps: The `@operational` Package Family

Operational UI is shipped as a [monorepo](https://danluu.com/monorepo/), with small packages covering various facets of data-driven UI's:
1. [Components](https://github.com/Contiamo/operational-ui/tree/master/packages/components), used in the example above, are the smallest and simplest building blocks, implemented as presentational, heavily [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) React components. Buttons, input fields, modals, date pickers, and the like.
1. [Blocks](https://github.com/Contiamo/operational-ui/tree/master/packages/blocks) hold more state, more side effects, more opinions. They are our work-in-progress selection of widgets that worked well with client projects and which seemed like a good enough abstraction for a library.
1. [Visualizations](https://github.com/Contiamo/operational-ui/tree/master/packages/visualizations) are full-featured d3 apps, 
1. The [theme](https://github.com/Contiamo/operational-ui/tree/master/packages/theme) package exports a plain object you can use to customize the designs of components and visualizations.
1. [Utils](https://github.com/Contiamo/operational-ui/tree/master/packages/utils) contain helper methods for color manipulation, creating specific higher-order React components, and d3 helpers.
1. [Showcase](https://github.com/Contiamo/operational-ui/tree/master/packages/showcase) is the documentation website for the modules.

## Working on Operational UI

After you install dependencies, simply run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` inside the `components` or `visualizations` packages. This spins up a dev server you can use to test packages, by editing the entry point at `./packages/{components,visualizations}/scripts/dev-server/site.tsx`.

To run the showcase, simply run `npm run start` or `yarn start` from root. 

To make sure your code is ready for Travis and your reviewers, run `npm run ci:local` or `yarn ci:local` from the root of the project.

### Generators

To create a new `component`, simply run `./scripts/create-component.sh ComponentName`. This will generate all the boilerplate, files like `ComponentName.tsx` and `ComponentName.test.tsx`, and points to a few remaining manual wiring steps to get your component, its tests and its showcase page in place. The boilerplate also tries to guide towards consistent practices around code style, state management and styling. Please ask if anything is unclear.

More generators coming soon..
