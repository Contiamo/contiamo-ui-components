`Operational UI` is a set of building blocks optimized for UI's supporting operational decision-making. It does best when used for heavily data-driven interfaces that assume familiarity through routine use, adding a bit more on the initial usage learning curve for the sake of compactness and space-efficiency. It encodes a [design language](https://ui.contiamo.com/design-guidelines) centered around [small effective differences](https://twitter.com/edwardtufte/status/450076034759524352) and an opinionated layout.

## Getting started

The `@operational/components` library contains atomic building blocks, and is a good place to start with Operational UI packages.

To install, simply grab the package via npm or yarn, along with `React` and `ReactDOM`:

`npm install @operational/components react react-dom`

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { render } from "react-dom"
import { OperationalUI, Button } from "@operational/components"

// Always wrap your interface in the `OperationalUI` wrapper, which does important setup work, and requires a single child element.
// See https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40operational%2Fcomponents for details.
const MyInterface = () => (
  <OperationalUI>
    <Button onClick={() => {alert("Hello!")}}>Say hello!</Button>
  </OperationalUI>
)

render(<MyInterface />, document.querySelector("#app"))
```

You have your first simple button. Head to our [getting started](https://ui.contiamo.com/getting-started) for more examples and live coding.

## Next Steps: the `@operational` Package Family

Operational UI is shipped as a [monorepo](https://danluu.com/monorepo/), with small packages covering various facets of data-driven UI's:
1. [Components](https://github.com/Contiamo/operational-ui/tree/master/packages/components), used in the example above, are the smallest and simplest building blocks, implemented as presentational, heavily [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) React components. Buttons, input fields, modals, date pickers, and the like.
1. [Blocks](https://github.com/Contiamo/operational-ui/tree/master/packages/blocks) hold more state, more side effects, more opinions. They are our work-in-progress selection of widgets that worked well with client projects and which seemed like a good enough abstraction for a library.
1. [Visualizations](https://github.com/Contiamo/operational-ui/tree/master/packages/visualizations) are full-featured d3 apps, 
1. The [theme](https://github.com/Contiamo/operational-ui/tree/master/packages/theme) package exports a plain object you can use to customize the designs of components and visualizations.
1. [Utils](https://github.com/Contiamo/operational-ui/tree/master/packages/utils) contain helper methods for color manipulation, creating specific higher-order React components, and d3 helpers.
1. [Showcase](https://github.com/Contiamo/operational-ui/tree/master/packages/showcase) is the documentation website for the modules.
