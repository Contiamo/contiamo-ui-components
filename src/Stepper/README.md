This component allows users to flow through a process in a more funnel/wizard style manner.

## Modal test

```jsx
import * as React from "react"
import { TestComp } from "../Stepper/Stepper.tsx"
// import ControlledModal from "./ControlledModal/"

const Comp = () => {
  return <TestComp />
}
;<Comp />
```
