This component is a simple footer that can be placed in [DataTable](/#/Components/DataTable)'s `footer` prop.

## In Isolation

For whatever reason, here's what the component looks like by itself.

```jsx
import * as React from "react"
import { DataTableFooter, SimpleLink } from "@operational/components"
;<DataTableFooter>
  <SimpleLink to="/#!/DataTable">Hello I am kind of lonely, please pair me with DataTable</SimpleLink>
</DataTableFooter>
```
