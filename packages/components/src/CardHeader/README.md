Using a CardHeader component is the standard way to add a title element to the card. This may include not just the card title, but also navigation on the right-hand side.

### Usage

```jsx
<Card>
    <CardHeader>Title for my card</CardHeader>
    <p>Here is a bare card with custom padding.</p>
    <img alt="Cat" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1491485880348-85d48a9e5312?w=500" />
</Card>
```
