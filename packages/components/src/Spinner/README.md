Spinners are used to indicate loading state in a smaller element, such as a card or a single, smaller form.

### Usage

Spinners render in custom sizes and colors.

```js
<>
  <Spinner />
  <Spinner color="primary" />
  <Spinner size={12} />
</>
```

### Bouncing mode

In addition to the regular spinning animation, there is a bouncing one that is designed to indicate that data already displayed on the page is being synced.

```js
<>
  <Spinner bounce />
</>
```
