Buttons are used heavily throughout an operational interface, and they often require a fair amount of customization. They exist independently or in groups, and can shrink to a condensed mode if space is short. These buttons can also take on any number of colors required.

### Simple usage

Using buttons is as simple as including the component with a text node as a child. Colors may be specified as hex strings, or as a pre-defined color key from the theme.

```jsx
<Button color="info">Button One</Button>
<Button color="#393939">Button Two</Button>
<Button disabled>Button Three</Button>
```
