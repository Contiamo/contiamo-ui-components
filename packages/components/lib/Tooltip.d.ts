/**
  The <Tooltip /> component.

  The problem:
  Say you have a container with `overflow: hidden`.
  Say this container has items that need to show tooltips, that appear
  _outside_ of page flow, and are not clipped by the overflow.

  The solution is to use `position: fixed`, with dynamically calculated
  positions at the time of mounting, but React makes this a little
  tricky, especially if you want a simple API.

  This solution:
  A tooltip is placed in an absolute position, relative to its parent,
  even risking getting cut off to overflow.

  At the time of mounting, this _perfect_ position of the tooltip is captured
  relative to `document`. These coordinates are then set as CSS properties
  on the tooltip, along with `position: fixed` and all is well with the
  world. ðŸŒˆ
